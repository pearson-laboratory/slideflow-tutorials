    "- ```grep \"pattern\" <file_name>```: Searches for a pattern in a file.\n",
    "- ```find /path/to/search -name \"file_pattern\"```: Searches for files in a directory hierarchy and finds files matching the given pattern.\n",
    "- ```echo <text_string>```: Displays a line of text/string that is passed as an argument (e.g. ```echo \"Hello World\"```: Prints \"Hello World\".) Equivalent to Python ```print()```. Useful for status updates in bash scripts. ```echo``` is also useful for printing the value of environment variables (e.g. ```echo $CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES```).\n",
    "- ```head <file_name>```: Shows the first 10 lines of a file.\n",

    "Multiprocessing in Python is a means to perform parallel processing by using multiple processors on a machine (as opposed to sequential/serial processing). This is particularly useful for CPU-bound tasks that can be parallelized. \n",
    "\n",
    "A *program* (like Python) is static: it is the data and information itself that needs to be processed and executed, while a *process* is when the actual program is in memory and under the control of the CPU.\n",
    "\n",
    "The library ```multiprocessing``` allows for executed \"parent\" processes to be divided into \"child\" processes which are executed in parallel (instead of all processes runnning sequentially). Each child process is assigned its own memory (RAM) and CPU *thread* (a thread is the virtual sequence of instructions given to a CPU). This massively speeds up processing time but also requires higher memory overheads, because each child process requires it's own memory (so memory is duplicated in an additive manner). So beware that what you trade for faster speeds, you lose in memory usage.\n",
    "\n",
    "Threads run within some process. A process can have more than one thread and each thread **shares** the memory and resources of the process (which means they can access shared data). Multithreading (versus multiprocessing) is how you can speed up computation but avoid the higher memory overheads. For example, Slideflow's ```extract_tiles()``` utilizes multithreading to speed up tile extraction."
